# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Infrastructure Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create MongoDB client, Base Repository pattern, Logger utility, and core type definitions
# Details:
Implement BaseMongoRepository class in src/mongo/repository/base.ts with generic CRUD operations (add, update, findById, findByFilters, delete). Create MongoDB connection client with proper error handling. Setup Winston logger with different log levels. Define core interfaces in src/types/types.d.ts for Application, Staff, Job, Case, GuildConfig, Retainer, Feedback models.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for BaseRepository CRUD operations, MongoDB connection tests, logger output verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. MongoDB connection client with error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a MongoDB connection client with comprehensive error handling, connection pooling, and retry logic
### Details:
Implement MongoDB client with connection management, error handling for network issues, authentication failures, and connection timeouts. Include connection pooling configuration and automatic retry mechanisms for failed connections.

## 2. BaseMongoRepository with generic CRUD operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement a generic base repository class providing standard CRUD operations for MongoDB collections
### Details:
Create BaseMongoRepository class with generic type support for create, read, update, delete operations. Include query building, pagination support, and transaction handling. Ensure proper error propagation and type safety.

## 3. Winston logger configuration and setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Winston logging system with appropriate log levels, formatters, and output destinations
### Details:
Set up Winston logger with multiple transport options (console, file, cloud). Configure log levels, custom formatters for different environments, and structured logging for better debugging and monitoring.

## 4. Core type definitions and interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define TypeScript interfaces and type definitions for the infrastructure layer components
### Details:
Create comprehensive type definitions for database entities, repository interfaces, logger types, and configuration objects. Ensure proper type safety across all infrastructure components and establish contracts for dependency injection.

## 5. Integration testing for all components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive integration tests covering all infrastructure components and their interactions
### Details:
Create integration tests for MongoDB client connectivity, repository operations, logging functionality, and component interactions. Include test database setup, cleanup procedures, and mock configurations for isolated testing environments.
