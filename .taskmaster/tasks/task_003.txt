# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Configuration & Permissions System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build GuildConfig model, repository, and permission validation service with admin management commands
# Details:
Create GuildConfig model with configurable elements (FEEDBACK_CHANNEL_ID, RETAINER_CHANNEL_ID, etc.). Implement GuildConfigRepository extending BaseMongoRepository. Build hasActionPermission service for role-based permission validation. Implement /admin commands (add, remove, grantrole, revokerole, list, setpermissionrole) and /config commands (set, view, setclientrole) using discordx decorators.
