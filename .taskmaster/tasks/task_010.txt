# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement System Utilities & Maintenance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive repair system, metrics tracking, and help documentation with health monitoring
# Details:
Implement /repair commands (staff-roles, job-roles, channels, config, orphaned, db-indexes, all, dry-run, health) with Discord-database synchronization logic. Create metrics aggregation for /metrics and /stats commands tracking application counts, staff distribution, case statistics, and system uptime. Build dynamic help system with /help and /slashes commands using Discord API introspection. Add debug commands (debug_collection, debug_wipe_collections, setupserver) with proper safety confirmations.

# Test Strategy:
Test all repair routines with dry-run mode, metrics calculation accuracy, help system command discovery, debug functionality safety

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database repair and synchronization routines [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement database integrity checks, repair mechanisms, and synchronization routines to maintain data consistency
### Details:
Create functions to validate database schema, check for orphaned records, repair corrupted data, and synchronize between different database components. Include transaction rollback capabilities and data validation checks.

## 2. Discord-database sync logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build synchronization mechanisms between Discord API data and local database records
### Details:
Implement bidirectional sync between Discord server state and database, handle Discord API rate limits, manage user/role/channel synchronization, and resolve conflicts between Discord and database states.

## 3. Metrics aggregation and calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create system for collecting, aggregating, and calculating various system and user metrics
### Details:
Build metrics collection framework, implement aggregation algorithms for user activity, system performance, and Discord interactions. Include historical data processing and real-time metric updates.

## 4. Dynamic help system with API introspection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop intelligent help system that dynamically generates documentation through API introspection
### Details:
Create system to automatically discover available commands, parameters, and features through code introspection. Generate contextual help content and maintain up-to-date documentation without manual updates.

## 5. Debug commands with safety confirmations [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement debug and administrative commands with built-in safety mechanisms and confirmation prompts
### Details:
Create debug commands for system inspection and manipulation, implement multi-step confirmation for destructive operations, add user permission checks, and provide detailed operation previews before execution.

## 6. Health monitoring and system status [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Build comprehensive health monitoring system to track system status and performance
### Details:
Implement health checks for database connectivity, Discord API status, system resources, and application components. Create status reporting dashboard and alerting mechanisms for system issues.

## 7. Dry-run mode implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Create dry-run mode functionality to preview operations without executing them
### Details:
Implement simulation mode for all administrative and potentially destructive operations. Provide detailed preview of changes, impact analysis, and rollback planning without actually modifying system state.
