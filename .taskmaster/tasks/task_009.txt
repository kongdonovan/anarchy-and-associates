# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Feedback & Reminder Systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create feedback collection with star ratings and time-based reminder functionality
# Details:
Define Feedback model with star ratings (1-5) and staff performance aggregation. Create FeedbackRepository with search capabilities by user and date range. Implement /feedback commands (submit, search) with integration to staff performance metrics. Build reminder system supporting human-readable time formats (10m, 2h, 1d) with maximum 7-day period. Use setTimeout for reminder delivery with proper error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test feedback submission and search, star rating aggregation, reminder parsing and delivery, time format validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Feedback model with star rating system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a feedback data model that supports star ratings and structured feedback collection
### Details:
Design and implement a feedback model with star rating validation, feedback text storage, timestamp tracking, and user identification. Include validation for rating ranges and data serialization.

## 2. FeedbackRepository with search capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement repository pattern for feedback storage with advanced search and filtering
### Details:
Create a repository class that handles feedback persistence, retrieval, and search operations. Include filtering by date ranges, rating levels, users, and text search capabilities.

## 3. Staff performance metrics aggregation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Build system to calculate and aggregate performance metrics from feedback data
### Details:
Implement metrics calculation including average ratings, feedback trends over time, performance scoring algorithms, and statistical analysis of staff performance based on collected feedback.

## 4. Reminder system with time parsing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create reminder scheduling system with natural language time parsing capabilities
### Details:
Implement time parsing logic to handle various time formats, schedule reminders, and manage reminder state. Include support for relative times, absolute timestamps, and recurring reminders.

## 5. Reminder delivery and timeout management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Build reminder delivery mechanism with timeout handling and memory management
### Details:
Implement reminder delivery system with timeout management, memory cleanup for expired reminders, error handling for failed deliveries, and retry mechanisms. Include proper resource management and cleanup procedures.
