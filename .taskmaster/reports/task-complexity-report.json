			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down project initialization into: 1) Node.js/TypeScript setup with dependencies, 2) Clean Architecture directory structure creation, 3) Development tooling configuration (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript), 4) Docker and environment configuration setup",
			"reasoning": "Foundation setup is moderately complex due to multiple moving parts but follows established patterns. Each component (package setup, architecture, tooling, containerization) represents a distinct area of work."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Infrastructure Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide infrastructure into: 1) MongoDB connection client with error handling, 2) BaseMongoRepository with generic CRUD operations, 3) Winston logger configuration and setup, 4) Core type definitions and interfaces, 5) Integration testing for all components",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to database abstraction layer design, generic repository pattern implementation, and ensuring proper error handling across multiple infrastructure components."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration & Permissions System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) GuildConfig model and database schema, 2) GuildConfigRepository implementation, 3) Permission validation service logic, 4) Admin management commands (/admin add, remove, etc.), 5) Configuration commands (/config set, view, etc.), 6) Role-based access control integration",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to permission system design requiring careful security considerations, role hierarchy management, and integration with Discord's permission model."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Staff Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Staff model with role hierarchy definition, 2) StaffRepository with custom queries, 3) StaffService business logic layer, 4) Discord role synchronization logic, 5) Staff management commands implementation, 6) Audit logging system, 7) Permission enforcement and validation",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to role hierarchy management, Discord API integration for role sync, audit logging requirements, and complex business logic for staff operations."

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Job model with custom questions JSON schema, 2) JobRepository with filtering and search, 3) Job management commands with pagination, 4) Custom application questions system, 5) Automatic role cleanup automation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to dynamic question system, pagination logic, and automated role management, but follows established CRUD patterns."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Retainer model and database schema, 2) RetainerRepository implementation, 3) DM-based signature workflow, 4) Discord modal forms for agreements, 5) Automatic client role assignment, 6) Agreement archival and formatting system",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to DM workflow management, legal document handling, and automated role assignment requiring careful state management."
		},
		{
