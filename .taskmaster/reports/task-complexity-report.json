			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backup and feature branch creation process into: 1) Create and verify git archive backup, 2) Create feature branch with proper naming convention, 3) Document current state and dependencies, 4) Establish baseline metrics and rollback plan",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward git operations with documentation requirements. Low technical complexity but important for project safety."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Custom Error Type Hierarchy",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Create base custom error class with context preservation, 2) Implement BusinessRuleError and ValidationError classes, 3) Implement PermissionError and NotFoundError classes, 4) Implement DatabaseError class, 5) Create error utility functions and factories, 6) Implement error serialization for logging",
			"reasoning": "Requires careful design of error hierarchy, context preservation, and integration with existing infrastructure. Multiple error types with consistent patterns."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Test Suite - Remove Non-Business Logic Tests",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Categorize and document all 31 test files, 2) Remove infrastructure and performance tests, 3) Remove security, concurrency, and E2E tests, 4) Update jest configuration and test scripts, 5) Verify remaining tests and measure performance improvement",
			"reasoning": "Requires careful identification of test types and safe removal without breaking remaining tests. Configuration updates needed across multiple files."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Remove Redundant Files and Clean Codebase",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Delete backup files and fix scripts, 2) Consolidate dev-server.ts and simple-dev.ts, 3) Update package.json references, 4) Run ts-unused-exports to find orphaned code, 5) Clean up unused imports and verify build",
			"reasoning": "Involves file deletion, consolidation, and dependency checking. Risk of breaking imports requires careful verification."

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create error handler middleware architecture, 2) Implement Discord command error interception, 3) Create consistent error embed formatting, 4) Update existing try-catch blocks to use custom errors, 5) Implement error context preservation, 6) Integrate with Winston logger, 7) Test with all command categories",
			"reasoning": "Requires middleware implementation for Discord.js, updating all 77+ commands, and ensuring consistent user experience. Integration with existing logging infrastructure adds complexity."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Create @AuditLog decorator implementation, 2) Design audit context capture system, 3) Standardize audit log format, 4) Apply decorator to admin commands, 5) Apply decorator to staff and case commands, 6) Apply decorator to remaining command categories, 7) Remove redundant audit code from services, 8) Integrate with AuditLogRepository",
			"reasoning": "Decorator pattern implementation with TypeScript, applying to 77+ commands across 11 command files. Requires careful context capture and integration with existing repository."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Lightweight Unit of Work Pattern",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Design UnitOfWork interface for MongoDB, 2) Implement transaction coordination logic, 3) Integrate with BaseMongoRepository, 4) Implement rollback capability, 5) Update staff management operations, 6) Update case creation operations, 7) Handle transaction error scenarios, 8) Test transaction isolation",
			"reasoning": "Complex pattern implementation with MongoDB transactions, requiring updates to multiple complex operations. Transaction management and rollback scenarios add significant complexity."
